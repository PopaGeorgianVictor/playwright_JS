#### Locate single element


##### link/button

```py
await page. locator('locator').click() await page.click('locator')
```
##### inputbox

```py
await page. locator('locator').fill('value') await page. locator('locator').type('value')
await page.fill('locator', 'value') await page.type('locator', 'value')
```

#### Locate multiple web elements

```py
const elements=await page.$$(locator)
```


## Built-in in locators

```
```py
page.getByAltText() to locate an element, usually image, by its text alternative.
```
```py
page.getByTitle() to locate an element by its title attribute.
```
```py
page.getByTestId() to locate an element based on its data-testid attribute
